# temperatures_task
Project from online course. Task solution.

First I download csv files of the data I need from online database with SQL code. And upload them here to repository.

Then,I continue working here. I need to compare global average temperatures with Stockholm average temperatures.
Make a moving average, present data as a line chart, compare them and make some observations.
